Exercise 1.25 asks us to take a closer look at the expmod procedure 
that we used in exercise 1.24 to compute the exponential of a number 
modulo another number:
(define (expmod base exp m)
   (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
         ((even? exp)
          (remainder (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                     m))
         (else
          (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                     m))))

We're asked to consider a more straightforward implementation of the same 
function. This version makes use of the fast-expt procedure from section 1.2.4, 
which I've also included here.
(define (expmod base exp m)
   (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))

(define (fast-expt b n)
   (cond ((= n 0) 1)
         ((even? n) (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
         (else (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))

Will this version perform just as well in the fast prime tester from exercise 1.24? 
The easiest way to answer that question is to drop it in and test it out. Starting 
out with relatively small values, you can see that the new procedure doesn't perform very well at all.
> (timed-prime-test 1999)

1999 *** 138.0
> (timed-prime-test 10007)

10007 *** 681.0
> (timed-prime-test 100003)

100003 *** 29059.0

These values are several orders of magnitude smaller than those used in the previous exercise, 
but the new procedure is taking a much longer time to complete. Why is that?

The answer is buried in a footnote to the expmod code (#46).
The reduction steps in the cases where the exponent e is greater than 1 are based on the fact that, 
for any integers x, y, and m, we can find the remainder of x times y modulo m by computing separately 
the remainders of x modulo m and y modulo m, multiplying these, and then taking the remainder of the result modulo m. 
For instance, in the case where e is even, we compute the remainder of be/2 modulo m, square this, 
and take the remainder modulo m. This technique is useful because it means we can perform our computation
without ever having to deal with numbers much larger than m.

The important point is that the original expmod procedure uses successive squaring to perform its 
computations without ever having to deal with numbers larger than m. Simple arithmetic with very large 
numbers is much slower than arithmetic with 32-bit integers. That's because the time complexity for arithmetic 
operations is based on the number of bits in the operands. The intermediate results during computation in the fast-expt 
procedure get very big, very quickly (the final result is growing exponentially, after all). Since we're only interested 
in the remainder, modular arithmetic provides a much sleeker solution, as explained in the footnote.

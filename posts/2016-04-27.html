1.2.4 Exponentiation
Consider the problem of computing the exponential of a given number. We would like a procedure
that takes as arguments a base b and a positive integer exponent n and computes bn. One way to do
this is via the recursive definition
b^n =  b * b^(n - 1)
b^0 = 1
which translates readily into the procedure
(define (expt b n)
(if (= n 0)
1
(* b (expt b (- n 1)))))
This is a linear recursive process, which requires  n steps and  n space. Just as with
factorial, we can readily formulate an equivalent linear iteration:
(define (expt b n)
(expt-iter b n 1))
(define (expt-iter b counter product)
(if (= counter 0)
product
(expt-iter b
(- counter 1)
(* b product))))
This version requires (n) steps and (1) space.
We can compute exponentials in fewer steps by using successive squaring. For instance, rather than
computing b8 as
b *( b *( b *( b *( b *( b *( b *( b))))))
we can compute it using three multiplications:
b2 = b * b
b4 = b2 * b2
b8 = b4 * b4
49
This method works fine for exponents that are powers of 2. We can also take advantage of
successive squaring in computing exponentials in general if we use the rule
b^n=(b^(b/2))^2 if n is even
b^n=  b * b^(n - 1) if n is odd
We can express this method as a procedure:
(define (fast-expt b n)
(cond ((= n 0) 1)
((even? n) (square (fast-expt b (/ n 2))))
(else (* b (fast-expt b (- n 1))))))
where the predicate to test whether an integer is even is defined in terms of the primitive procedure
remainder by
(define (even? n)
(= (remainder n 2) 0))
The process evolved by fast-expt grows logarithmically with n in both space and number of
steps. To see this, observe that computing b2n using fast-expt requires only one more
multiplication than computing bn. The size of the exponent we can compute therefore doubles
(approximately) with every new multiplication we are allowed. Thus, the number of multiplications
required for an exponent of n grows about as fast as the logarithm of n to the base 2. The process
has  log n growth.37
The difference between  log n growth and  n growth becomes striking as n becomes
large. For example, fast-expt for n = 1000 requires only 14 multiplications.38 It is also possible
to use the idea of successive squaring to devise an iterative algorithm that computes exponentials
with a logarithmic number of steps (see exercise 1.16), although, as is often the case with iterative
algorithms, this is not written down so straightforwardly as the recursive algorithm.39


Exercise 1.16. Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses
successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt. (Hint: Using the
observation that (bn/2)2 = (b2)n/2, keep, along with the exponent n and the base b, an additional state
variable a, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product a bn is unchanged
from state to state. At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the
value of a at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an invariant quantity that
remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative
algorithms.)

here is all the lisp program describe in the above text and the exercise 1.16.
